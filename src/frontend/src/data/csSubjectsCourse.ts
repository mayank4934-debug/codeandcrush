      notes: `WELCOME TO CS SUBJECTS!

Hey! I'm so excited to be your companion on this CS Subjects journey! 💻 These core computer science subjects are asked in virtually every technical interview — OS, DBMS, Networks, Theory of Computation, Compiler Design, and Digital Electronics are the foundation of your CS knowledge. Let's master them together!

COURSE OVERVIEW
CS Subjects covers the fundamental theoretical and systems-level topics taught in computer science curricula worldwide and tested rigorously in campus placements and technical interviews. You'll deeply understand how operating systems manage processes and memory, how databases store and query data, how networks transmit information, the theory behind computation, how compilers transform code, and how digital logic circuits work.

HOW THIS COURSE WORKS
This course has 6 modules, each unlocking after you complete the previous one. Each module has several Parts. Every Part contains: a Video (watch to learn), a Lesson (read for deeper understanding), a Documentation link (open in-app for reference), and a Quiz (15 MCQs to test your knowledge). CS Subjects are primarily theoretical — coding questions appear only in parts where programming is explicitly taught. After all parts, there's a Module Test. Complete the test to unlock the next module!

HOW YOU EARN
• 5 XP per correct MCQ answer in quizzes
• 20 XP per completed coding question
• Badges for completing each module
• SP (Study Points) for in-app purchases
• GCoins for daily challenges and streaks

ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME: ~45 hours
This is a rigorous theory course. Dedicate 1–2 hours per day and you'll be interview-ready in about 5–6 weeks.

1. Operating Systems — Processes & threads, memory management, file systems, deadlocks, scheduling
2. DBMS — Relational model, SQL, normalization (1NF–BCNF), transactions, ACID, indexing
3. Computer Networks — OSI/TCP-IP model, IP addressing, routing protocols, TCP vs UDP, DNS, HTTP
4. Theory of Computation — Finite automata, regular languages, CFGs, Turing machines, decidability
5. Compiler Design — Lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, optimization
6. Digital Electronics — Logic gates, Boolean algebra, combinational/sequential circuits, flip-flops`,

• Video — A curated video explaining the concept visually
• Lesson — In-depth readable content you can study at your own pace
• Documentation — In-app reference material for that topic
• Quiz — 15 multiple-choice questions (5 XP each) to reinforce learning

CS Subjects is primarily theoretical — most parts focus on deep conceptual understanding tested through quizzes. Coding questions appear in very few parts (e.g., SQL queries, basic algorithm implementations).

Module Unlock Rules:
• Module 1 is always unlocked and ready to start
• Each subsequent module unlocks after you pass the previous module's test
• You can retake quizzes to improve your score`,

1. Read the course overview above — understand what CS Subjects covers and why it matters for interviews
2. Meet your study companion — they'll guide you through every lesson with hints and encouragement
3. Understand how modules unlock — complete one module's test to access the next
4. Know how quizzes work — 15 MCQs per part to test your conceptual understanding
5. Check your XP progress bar in the sidebar — it grows as you complete lessons and quizzes
6. You're all set! Head to Module 1 below to begin your CS Subjects journey 🎉`,
