      notes: `WELCOME TO CYBERSECURITY!

Hey! I'm thrilled to be your companion on this Cybersecurity journey! 🔐 Cybersecurity is one of the most critical and rapidly growing fields in tech — every organization needs skilled security professionals. You'll learn to think like an attacker to defend like a professional!

COURSE OVERVIEW
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. You'll study core security principles (CIA Triad), network security, ethical hacking and penetration testing, web application security (OWASP Top 10), cryptography, and incident response. Cybersecurity professionals are essential in every industry and command premium salaries.

HOW THIS COURSE WORKS
This course has 3 modules, each unlocking after you complete the previous one. Each module has several Parts. Every Part contains: a Video (watch to learn), a Lesson (read for deeper understanding), a Documentation link (open in-app for reference), a Quiz (15 MCQs to test your knowledge). Theory-heavy modules in Cybersecurity may not have coding questions — this is by design since the field emphasizes concepts, tools, and analysis. After all parts, there's a Module Test. Complete the test to unlock the next module!

HOW YOU EARN
• 5 XP per correct MCQ answer in quizzes
• 20 XP per completed coding question
• Badges for completing each module
• SP (Study Points) for in-app purchases
• GCoins for daily challenges and streaks

ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME: ~35 hours
This is a practical cybersecurity course. Dedicate 1–2 hours per day and you'll have core security skills in about 4 weeks.

WHAT TO DO NEXT
Complete the Getting Started checklist below, then scroll down to Module 1 to begin! 🚀`,

1. Security Fundamentals — CIA Triad, threat landscape, attack vectors, risk management
2. Networking — TCP/IP, firewalls, VPNs, DNS security, network scanning tools
3. Ethical Hacking — Penetration testing methodology, reconnaissance, exploitation
4. Web Security — OWASP Top 10, SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, secure coding
5. Cryptography — Symmetric/asymmetric encryption, hashing, TLS, digital signatures
6. Incident Response — Detection, containment, eradication, recovery, forensics`,

• Video — A curated video explaining the concept visually
• Lesson — In-depth readable content you can study at your own pace
• Documentation — In-app reference material for that topic
• Quiz — 15 multiple-choice questions (5 XP each) to reinforce learning
• Coding Questions — Only in parts where scripting or code analysis is taught

Most cybersecurity topics are conceptual and tool-based, so many parts will not have traditional coding questions. This is intentional — understanding concepts deeply is more important than syntax in this field.

Module Unlock Rules:
• Module 1 is always unlocked and ready to start
• Each subsequent module unlocks after you pass the previous module's test
• You can retake quizzes to improve your score`,

1. Read the course overview above — understand what cybersecurity is and why it matters
2. Meet your study companion — they'll guide you through every lesson with hints and encouragement
3. Understand how modules unlock — complete one module's test to access the next
4. Know how quizzes work — 15 MCQs per part (coding questions only in scripting topics)
5. Check your XP progress bar in the sidebar — it grows as you complete lessons and quizzes
6. You're all set! Head to Module 1 below to begin your Cybersecurity journey 🎉`,
