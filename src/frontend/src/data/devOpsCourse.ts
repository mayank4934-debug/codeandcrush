      notes: `WELCOME TO DEVOPS!

Hey! I'm thrilled to be your companion on this DevOps journey! ⚙️ DevOps is the bridge between development and operations — it's the discipline of shipping software faster, more reliably, and at scale. You'll be the person who makes deployments smooth and systems bulletproof!

COURSE OVERVIEW
DevOps is a culture and set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. You'll master Linux and shell scripting for automation, Git and CI/CD for continuous integration and delivery, Docker and Kubernetes for containerization, Terraform and AWS for cloud infrastructure, and monitoring/security practices. DevOps engineers are in extremely high demand across all tech companies.

HOW THIS COURSE WORKS
This course has 5 modules, each unlocking after you complete the previous one. Each module has several Parts. Every Part contains: a Video (watch to learn), a Lesson (read for deeper understanding), a Documentation link (open in-app for reference), a Quiz (15 MCQs to test your knowledge), and Coding Questions (in scripting/config parts). After all parts, there's a Module Test. Complete the test to unlock the next module!

HOW YOU EARN
• 5 XP per correct MCQ answer in quizzes
• 20 XP per completed coding question
• Badges for completing each module
• SP (Study Points) for in-app purchases
• GCoins for daily challenges and streaks

ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME: ~35 hours
This is a practical DevOps course. Dedicate 1–2 hours per day and you'll have a solid DevOps skill set in about 4 weeks.

1. Linux Basics — Command line, file system, processes, permissions, shell scripting
2. Git & CI/CD — Version control, branching strategies, GitHub Actions, Jenkins
3. Docker — Containers, images, Dockerfiles, Docker Compose
4. Kubernetes — Orchestration, pods, deployments, services, Helm charts
5. Cloud Platforms — AWS core services, Terraform IaC, infrastructure automation
6. Monitoring — Prometheus, Grafana, logging, alerting, DevSecOps practices
7. Projects — End-to-end CI/CD pipeline and cloud deployment projects`,

• Video — A curated video explaining the concept visually
• Lesson — In-depth readable content you can study at your own pace
• Documentation — In-app reference material for that topic
• Quiz — 15 multiple-choice questions (5 XP each) to reinforce learning
• Coding Questions — Shell scripting and config file exercises in coding parts

Pure conceptual parts (like cloud architecture theory) may not have coding questions. Only parts where you write shell scripts, YAML configs, or Terraform code include programming exercises.

Module Unlock Rules:
• Module 1 is always unlocked and ready to start
• Each subsequent module unlocks after you pass the previous module's test
• You can retake quizzes to improve your score`,

1. Read the course overview above — understand what DevOps is and why it matters
2. Meet your study companion — they'll guide you through every lesson with hints and encouragement
3. Understand how modules unlock — complete one module's test to access the next
4. Know how quizzes work — 15 MCQs per part, plus coding questions in scripting topics
5. Check your XP progress bar in the sidebar — it grows as you complete lessons and quizzes
6. You're all set! Head to Module 1 below to begin your DevOps journey 🎉`,
