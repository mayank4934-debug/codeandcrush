      notes: `WELCOME TO PYTHON DEVELOPMENT!

Hey! I'm so excited to be your coding companion on this Python journey! 🐍 Python is one of the most beginner-friendly AND most powerful languages out there — used by Google, Netflix, NASA, and countless others. I'll be right here to guide you from your very first print() to building full applications!

COURSE OVERVIEW
Python is the world's most popular programming language, and for good reason — it's readable, versatile, and powerful. Whether you want to build web apps, automate tasks, analyze data, or get into AI/ML, Python is the gateway. This course takes you from absolute basics all the way to object-oriented programming and real projects.

HOW THIS COURSE WORKS
This course has 5 modules, each unlocking after you complete the previous one. Each module has several Parts. Every Part contains: a Video (watch to learn), a Lesson (read for deeper understanding), a Documentation link (open in-app for reference), a Quiz (15 MCQs to test your knowledge), and Coding Questions (in parts where you write Python code). After all parts, there's a Module Test. Complete the test to unlock the next module!

HOW YOU EARN
• 5 XP per correct MCQ answer in quizzes
• 20 XP per completed coding question
• Badges for completing each module
• SP (Study Points) for in-app purchases
• GCoins for daily challenges and streaks

ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME: ~30 hours
This is a focused Python course. Dedicate 1–2 hours per day and you'll be writing real Python apps in about 3 weeks.

WHAT TO DO NEXT
Complete the Getting Started checklist below, then scroll down to Module 1 to begin! 🚀`,

1. Python Basics — Setup, syntax, variables, data types, print & input
2. Variables & I/O — Type conversion, string operations, user interaction
3. Control Flow — If/else, loops (for/while), break/continue, comprehensions
4. Functions — Defining functions, parameters, scope, lambda, decorators
5. Data Structures — Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and operations on each
6. OOP — Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
7. File I/O & Modules — Reading/writing files, standard library, custom modules
8. Capstone Projects — Real-world Python programs to solidify your skills`,

• Video — A curated video explaining the concept visually
• Lesson — In-depth readable content you can study at your own pace
• Documentation — In-app reference material for that topic
• Quiz — 15 multiple-choice questions (5 XP each) to reinforce learning
• Coding Questions — Hands-on Python exercises in parts where you write code

Theory-only parts do NOT have coding questions. Only parts where you write actual Python code include programming exercises.

Module Unlock Rules:
• Module 1 is always unlocked and ready to start
• Each subsequent module unlocks after you pass the previous module's test
• You can retake quizzes to improve your score`,

1. Read the course overview above — understand what Python is and why it matters
2. Meet your study companion — they'll guide you through every lesson with hints and encouragement
3. Understand how modules unlock — complete one module's test to access the next
4. Know how quizzes work — 15 MCQs per part, plus coding questions in coding topics
5. Check your XP progress bar in the sidebar — it grows as you complete lessons and quizzes
6. You're all set! Head to Module 1 below to begin your Python journey 🎉`,
