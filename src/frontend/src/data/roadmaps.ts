Lists are mutable (list.append, list.pop), tuples are immutable. Dicts: key-value pairs, dict[key] = value, dict.get(key, default). Sets: unordered, no duplicates — good for membership tests. List comprehension: [x*2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]. f-strings: f'Hello {name}, you are {age} years old'. Functions: def greet(name, greeting='Hello'). *args collects positional, **kwargs collects keyword arguments. File I/O: with open('file.txt', 'r') as f: data = f.read(). Exception handling: try/except/else/finally. Use virtual environments: python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate.",

API Routes: /app/api/route.ts export GET, POST handlers. Rendering: SSR (per request), SSG (at build time), ISR (regenerate on interval). getServerSideProps vs getStaticProps (Pages Router).

Slower but solves key distribution — used in TLS handshake. Hashing: one-way function, fixed output — SHA-256, SHA-3. Used for integrity checks and password storage. Salt: random data added before hashing — prevents rainbow table attacks. bcrypt, Argon2: password hashing functions with built-in salting and slow computation (by design). HMAC: hash + secret key for message authentication. PKI: Certificate Authority signs certificates. TLS: server sends certificate, client verifies it. Forward secrecy: new session keys each time so past traffic can't be decrypted. PGP for email encryption.",

          "Rendering pipeline: CPU sends draw calls → GPU processes vertices → rasterization → fragment/pixel shader → output. Vertex shader: runs per-vertex, transforms 3D positions to screen space. Fragment shader: runs per-pixel, determines final color. HLSL (High Level Shading Language): syntax similar to C. Unity Shader Graph: visual node-based shader editor — no code needed. Key nodes: UV, Texture Sample, Normal Map, Fresnel Effect, Lerp, Gradient. URP (Universal Render Pipeline) and HDRP (High Definition RP) in modern Unity. PBR (Physically Based Rendering): Albedo (base color), Metallic, Roughness, Normal map, Ambient Occlusion — mimics real-world light physics. Post-processing: Bloom, Color Grading, Depth of Field, Motion Blur. Optimize: batch draw calls, use LODs (Level of Detail) for distant objects, occlusion culling.",

Color: 60-30-10 rule (primary color 60%, secondary 30%, accent 10%). Color theory: complementary (opposite on wheel), analogous (adjacent), triadic. Typography: limit to 2 font families (one serif, one sans-serif). Size scale: 12/14/16/20/24/32/48. Line height: 1.5x font size for body text. Letter spacing: tight for headings, normal for body. Spacing system: base unit of 4px or 8px — all spacing is a multiple. Contrast ratio: 4.5:1 minimum for normal text (WCAG AA), 3:1 for large text. F-pattern and Z-pattern: how users scan pages. Gestalt principles: proximity, similarity, continuity, closure.",

Components: master + instances, changes propagate. Variants: component property with multiple states (default/hover/active/disabled). Styles: color styles, text styles, effect styles — define once, reuse everywhere. Design tokens: systematized values (--color-primary, --spacing-md) exported for developers. Prototypes: connect frames with interactions and transitions. Smart Animate for micro-interactions. Dev Mode: shows CSS, spacing, assets — developers inspect directly. Plugins: Unsplash, Iconify, Content Reel, Figma to Code. Design handoff: use Zeplin or Figma's built-in inspect for developer specs.",

Quantitative: surveys (scale questions, NPS), analytics (funnel analysis, heatmaps), A/B tests. 5-user rule: 5 participants reveal ~85% of usability issues (Jakob Nielsen). Personas: fictional composite users based on research data — name, goals, frustrations. NOT demographic stereotypes. Customer journey map: touchpoints + actions + thoughts + emotions + opportunities. Jobs-to-be-done: 'When I [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]'. Usability testing script: task scenarios (not instructions — 'Buy a birthday gift for a friend'), think-aloud protocol. Affinity mapping: group insights from research into themes.",

Screen readers: NVDA (Windows), VoiceOver (Mac/iOS), TalkBack (Android). Semantic HTML is the foundation: <button> not <div onclick>.
