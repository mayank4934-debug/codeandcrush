      notes: `WELCOME TO BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPMENT!

Hey! I'm so excited to be your companion on this Blockchain Development journey! ⛓️ Blockchain is one of the most innovative technologies of the 21st century — it's powering cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance, NFTs, supply chain transparency, and so much more. Get ready to build on the future of the internet!

COURSE OVERVIEW
Blockchain development is the art of building decentralized applications (DApps) on distributed ledger networks. You'll start with blockchain fundamentals (how blocks, chains, and consensus work), dive into cryptography (hashing, digital signatures), learn Solidity for writing smart contracts on Ethereum, use Web3.js and Ethers.js to connect web apps to the blockchain, and build complete DApps.

HOW THIS COURSE WORKS
This course has 3 modules, each unlocking after you complete the previous one. Each module has several Parts. Every Part contains: a Video (watch to learn), a Lesson (read for deeper understanding), a Documentation link (open in-app for reference), a Quiz (15 MCQs to test your knowledge), and Coding Questions (in parts where you write Solidity or Web3 code). After all parts, there's a Module Test. Complete the test to unlock the next module!

HOW YOU EARN
• 5 XP per correct MCQ answer in quizzes
• 20 XP per completed coding question
• Badges for completing each module
• SP (Study Points) for in-app purchases
• GCoins for daily challenges and streaks

ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME: ~35 hours
This is a focused blockchain course. Dedicate 1–2 hours per day and you'll be deploying your first smart contract in about 4 weeks.

WHAT TO DO NEXT
Complete the Getting Started checklist below, then scroll down to Module 1 to begin! 🚀`,

1. Blockchain Basics — How blockchains work, distributed ledgers, consensus mechanisms, nodes
2. Cryptography — Hashing (SHA-256), digital signatures, public/private keys, Merkle trees
3. Consensus Mechanisms — Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Byzantine fault tolerance
4. Smart Contracts — Solidity syntax, state variables, functions, events, modifiers
5. DApps — Connecting Web3.js/Ethers.js to smart contracts, MetaMask integration
6. Projects — Build and deploy a complete DApp on the Ethereum testnet`,

• Video — A curated video explaining the concept visually
• Lesson — In-depth readable content you can study at your own pace
• Documentation — In-app reference material for that topic
• Quiz — 15 multiple-choice questions (5 XP each) to reinforce learning
• Coding Questions — Solidity/Web3 exercises in coding parts

Conceptual parts (like "How consensus works") do NOT have coding questions. Only parts where you write Solidity or interact with the blockchain include programming exercises.

Module Unlock Rules:
• Module 1 is always unlocked and ready to start
• Each subsequent module unlocks after you pass the previous module's test
• You can retake quizzes to improve your score`,

1. Read the course overview above — understand what blockchain development is and why it matters
2. Meet your study companion — they'll guide you through every lesson with hints and encouragement
3. Understand how modules unlock — complete one module's test to access the next
4. Know how quizzes work — 15 MCQs per part, plus coding questions in coding topics
5. Check your XP progress bar in the sidebar — it grows as you complete lessons and quizzes
6. You're all set! Head to Module 1 below to begin your Blockchain Development journey 🎉`,
