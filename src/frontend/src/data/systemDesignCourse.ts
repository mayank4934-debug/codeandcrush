      notes: `WELCOME TO SYSTEM DESIGN!

Hey! I'm so excited to be your companion on this System Design journey! 🏗️ System design is the skill that separates junior engineers from senior engineers — it's how you think about building systems that serve millions of users reliably. This knowledge is tested in every FAANG and big tech interview!

COURSE OVERVIEW
System Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data flow of a system to satisfy specified requirements. You'll master scalability fundamentals, database design and sharding, API design principles, caching strategies, message queues and event-driven architecture, microservices patterns, and real-world case studies like designing URL shorteners, Twitter, YouTube, and WhatsApp.

HOW THIS COURSE WORKS
This course has 5 modules, each unlocking after you complete the previous one. Each module has several Parts. Every Part contains: a Video (watch to learn), a Lesson (read for deeper understanding), a Documentation link (open in-app for reference), and a Quiz (15 MCQs to test your knowledge). System Design is primarily conceptual and architecture-focused — coding questions appear only in parts where specific implementation is taught. After all parts, there's a Module Test. Complete the test to unlock the next module!

HOW YOU EARN
• 5 XP per correct MCQ answer in quizzes
• 20 XP per completed coding question
• Badges for completing each module
• SP (Study Points) for in-app purchases
• GCoins for daily challenges and streaks

ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME: ~30 hours
This is a focused, concept-heavy course. Dedicate 1–2 hours per day and you'll be acing system design interviews in about 3–4 weeks.

1. Scalability Basics — Horizontal vs vertical scaling, CAP theorem, latency vs throughput
2. Database Design — SQL vs NoSQL, sharding, replication, indexing strategies, consistency models
3. API Design — REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC, versioning, rate limiting, authentication patterns
4. Caching — Cache invalidation, Redis, CDNs, cache-aside vs write-through patterns
5. Message Queues — Kafka, RabbitMQ, event-driven architecture, pub/sub patterns
6. Microservices — Service decomposition, API gateways, service discovery, circuit breakers
7. Real-World Case Studies — Design URL shortener, Twitter feed, YouTube, WhatsApp, Uber`,

• Video — A curated video explaining the concept visually
• Lesson — In-depth readable content you can study at your own pace
• Documentation — In-app reference material for that topic
• Quiz — 15 multiple-choice questions (5 XP each) to reinforce learning

System Design is primarily architectural and conceptual. Most parts do not have traditional coding questions — instead, they test your ability to reason about trade-offs, design decisions, and architectural patterns through quizzes.

Module Unlock Rules:
• Module 1 is always unlocked and ready to start
• Each subsequent module unlocks after you pass the previous module's test
• You can retake quizzes to improve your score`,

1. Read the course overview above — understand what system design is and why it matters for interviews
2. Meet your study companion — they'll guide you through every lesson with hints and encouragement
3. Understand how modules unlock — complete one module's test to access the next
4. Know how quizzes work — 15 MCQs per part testing your architecture reasoning skills
5. Check your XP progress bar in the sidebar — it grows as you complete lessons and quizzes
