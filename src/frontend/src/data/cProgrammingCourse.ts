      notes: `WELCOME TO PROGRAMMING IN C!

Hey there! I'm so excited to be your coding companion on this C programming journey! 💙 C is the grandfather of modern programming — once you understand it, every other language makes so much more sense. I'll be right here with you every step of the way, cheering you on!

COURSE OVERVIEW
C is one of the most powerful and foundational programming languages ever created. It runs the Linux kernel, embedded systems, game engines, and countless critical applications. Learning C teaches you how computers actually work — memory management, pointers, and low-level operations that most modern languages hide from you. This course takes you from zero to confident with a real, structured learning path.

HOW THIS COURSE WORKS
This course has 5 modules, each unlocking after you complete the previous one. Each module has several Parts. Every Part contains: a Video (watch to learn), a Lesson (read for deeper understanding), a Documentation link (open in-app for reference), a Quiz (15 MCQs to test your knowledge), and Coding Questions (in parts where you write actual code). After all parts, there's a Module Test. Complete the test to unlock the next module!

HOW YOU EARN
• 5 XP per correct MCQ answer in quizzes
• 20 XP per completed coding question
• Badges for completing each module
• SP (Study Points) for in-app purchases
• GCoins for daily challenges and streaks

ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME: ~35 hours
This is a comprehensive C programming course. Dedicate 1–2 hours per day and you'll be done in about 3–4 weeks.

      notes: `COMPUTER SYSTEM OVERVIEW
========================

A computer system consists of hardware and software working together to process information.

HARDWARE COMPONENTS
--------------------
• Memory (RAM): Volatile storage that holds data and instructions currently in use. Measured in GB. Faster access than disk.
• Processor (CPU): The brain of the computer. Executes instructions, performs arithmetic, logic and control operations. Clock speed in GHz.
• I/O Devices: Input (keyboard, mouse, scanner) send data to CPU. Output (monitor, printer, speaker) receive data from CPU.
• Storage: Non-volatile — HDD (magnetic, slower, cheap) or SSD (flash, faster, costlier). Holds OS, programs, and files permanently.
• Motherboard: Main circuit board connecting all components via buses.

SOFTWARE LAYERS
---------------
• Operating System (OS): Manages hardware resources, provides a user interface, and runs programs. Examples: Windows, Linux, macOS. Key functions: process management, memory management, file system, I/O management.

LANGUAGE PROCESSING TOOLS
--------------------------
• Assembler: Translates Assembly language (mnemonics like MOV, ADD) into machine code (binary). One-to-one translation.
• Compiler: Translates an entire high-level program (like C) into machine code in one pass. Output is an executable file. Errors shown after full compilation. Examples: GCC, Clang.
• Interpreter: Translates and executes code line-by-line at runtime. Slower but easier to debug. Examples: Python interpreter, JavaScript engines.
• Loader: Part of OS that loads an executable file from disk into RAM and prepares it for execution. Resolves addresses.
• Linker: Combines multiple object files (.o) and library files into a single executable. Resolves external symbol references (e.g., printf from libc).

COMPILATION PROCESS (C Program)
---------------------------------
Source Code (.c) → Preprocessor → Expanded Source → Compiler → Assembly Code (.s) → Assembler → Object Code (.o) → Linker → Executable

KEY DISTINCTION
---------------
• Compiler vs Interpreter: Compiler produces a standalone executable (faster execution). Interpreter needs to be present at runtime (slower, more portable).
• Loader vs Linker: Linker works at compile-time to combine files. Loader works at runtime to bring executable into memory.`,

      notes: `ALGORITHMS AND THEIR REPRESENTATION
=====================================

WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?
---------------------
An algorithm is a finite, ordered set of well-defined instructions to solve a problem or accomplish a task. Properties:
• Finiteness: Must terminate after a finite number of steps.
• Definiteness: Each step must be precise and unambiguous.
• Input: Zero or more inputs.
• Output: One or more outputs.
• Effectiveness: Each step must be basic enough to be done in finite time.

FLOWCHARTS
-----------
A visual diagram using standardized symbols:
• Oval/Rounded Rectangle: Start / End (Terminal)
• Rectangle: Process (calculation, assignment)
• Diamond: Decision (Yes/No or True/False branch)
• Parallelogram: Input / Output
• Arrow: Flow of control

Example — Find larger of two numbers:
  START → Input A, B → Is A > B? → Yes: Print A → END
                                 → No:  Print B → END

PSEUDOCODE
-----------
A human-readable description of an algorithm using plain English mixed with programming constructs. No strict syntax rules.

Example:
  BEGIN
    READ num1, num2
    IF num1 > num2 THEN
      PRINT num1, "is larger"
    ELSE
      PRINT num2, "is larger"
    END IF
  END

FROM ALGORITHM TO SOURCE CODE
------------------------------
1. Understand the problem clearly.
2. Design the algorithm (pseudocode or flowchart).
3. Write source code in a programming language (C, Python, etc.).
4. Compile/run and test.
5. Debug if output is incorrect.

Source code is the human-readable form of a program written in a language like C. It is then compiled into machine code the computer can execute.

GOOD ALGORITHM CHARACTERISTICS
--------------------------------
• Correctness — produces correct output for all valid inputs.
• Efficiency — uses minimal time and memory.
• Clarity — easy to understand and maintain.`,

Before writing code, designing a clear algorithm saves time and prevents logical errors.",

      notes: `BASICS OF C PROGRAMMING
========================

STRUCTURE OF A C PROGRAM
--------------------------
#include <stdio.h>      // Preprocessor directive — includes standard I/O library

int main() {            // main() is the entry point of every C program
    printf("Hello!");   // Statement — prints to console
    return 0;           // Returns 0 to OS (0 = success)
}

SYNTAX vs LOGICAL ERRORS
--------------------------
• Syntax Error: Violation of grammar rules — caught by compiler. Example: missing semicolon, undeclared variable.
• Logical Error: Program compiles and runs but produces wrong result. Must be found by testing.
• Object Code: Machine code produced by compiler from source code (.o file).
• Executable Code: Final runnable file after linking all object files.

STANDARD I/O IN C
------------------
• printf(): Output — printf("Sum = %d\\n", sum);
• scanf(): Input  — scanf("%d", &num);
Format specifiers: %d (int), %f (float), %c (char), %s (string), %lf (double)
Escape sequences: \\n (newline), \\t (tab), \\\\ (backslash)

FUNDAMENTAL DATA TYPES
-----------------------
| Type    | Size     | Range                    | Format |
|---------|----------|--------------------------|--------|
| int     | 4 bytes  | -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647 | %d |
| float   | 4 bytes  | ~±3.4 × 10^38 (6 digits)   | %f |
| double  | 8 bytes  | ~±1.7 × 10^308 (15 digits) | %lf|
| char    | 1 byte   | -128 to 127 (ASCII)      | %c |
| void    | —        | No value / no return     | — |

VARIABLES AND MEMORY
---------------------
• A variable is a named memory location that stores a value.
• Declaration: int age;  (reserves memory)
• Initialization: int age = 20;  (reserves + assigns value)
• Rule: Must be declared before use. Names: letters, digits, underscore; cannot start with digit.

STORAGE CLASSES
----------------
• auto: Default for local variables. Created when block is entered, destroyed when exited.
• register: Hint to compiler to store in CPU register (faster access). Cannot take address.
• static: Retains value between function calls. Initialized only once.
• extern: Declares a variable defined in another file. Used for global scope across files.

Example:
  void counter() {
      static int count = 0;  // retains value across calls
      count++;
      printf("%d\\n", count);
  }`,

      notes: `OPERATORS IN C
===============

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
---------------------
+  Addition        a + b
-  Subtraction     a - b
*  Multiplication  a * b
/  Division        a / b  (integer division if both operands are int)
%  Modulo          a % b  (remainder)

Example: 7 / 2 = 3 (int), 7.0 / 2 = 3.5 (float), 7 % 2 = 1

RELATIONAL OPERATORS
---------------------
>   Greater than       ==  Equal to
<   Less than          !=  Not equal to
>=  Greater or equal   <=  Less or equal
Returns 1 (true) or 0 (false)

LOGICAL OPERATORS
------------------
&&  Logical AND — true only if both operands are true
||  Logical OR  — true if at least one operand is true
!   Logical NOT — reverses the truth value

Short-circuit evaluation: In A && B, if A is false, B is never evaluated.

BITWISE OPERATORS
------------------
&   Bitwise AND    |   Bitwise OR    ^   Bitwise XOR
~   Bitwise NOT    <<  Left shift    >>  Right shift

Example: 5 & 3 → 0101 & 0011 = 0001 = 1
         5 | 3 → 0101 | 0011 = 0111 = 7
         5 << 1 → multiply by 2 = 10

ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
---------------------
=   Simple assignment      +=  Add and assign
-=  Subtract and assign    *=  Multiply and assign
/=  Divide and assign      %=  Modulo and assign

OPERATOR PRECEDENCE (High → Low)
----------------------------------
1. () Parentheses
2. ++, -- (unary), ! (NOT), ~ (bitwise NOT)
3. *, /, %
4. +, -
5. <<, >> (bit shift)
6. <, <=, >, >=
7. ==, !=
8. & (bitwise AND)
9. ^ (bitwise XOR)
10. | (bitwise OR)
11. && (logical AND)
12. || (logical OR)
13. ?: (ternary)
14. =, +=, -= etc. (assignment)

TYPE CONVERSION
----------------
• Implicit (automatic): int + float → float. Lower type promoted to higher.
• Explicit (cast): (float) a / b forces float division.

Example: int a = 5; float result = (float) a / 2; // result = 2.5`,

      notes: `CONDITIONAL BRANCHING IN C
===========================

IF STATEMENT
-------------
if (condition) {
    // executes if condition is true
}

IF-ELSE
--------
if (marks >= 50) {
    printf("Pass");
} else {
    printf("Fail");
}

IF-ELSE IF-ELSE (Ladder)
-------------------------
if (marks >= 90)      printf("Grade A");
else if (marks >= 75) printf("Grade B");
else if (marks >= 60) printf("Grade C");
else                  printf("Grade D");

NESTED IF
----------
if (age >= 18) {
    if (hasID) {
        printf("Entry allowed");
    } else {
        printf("Need ID");
    }
}

SWITCH STATEMENT
-----------------
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code
        break;     // IMPORTANT: break prevents fall-through
    case value2:
        // code
        break;
    default:
        // runs if no case matches
}

Example — Day of week:
switch (day) {
    case 1: printf("Monday"); break;
    case 2: printf("Tuesday"); break;
    default: printf("Invalid day");
}

SWITCH vs IF-ELSE
------------------
• switch: Best for discrete integer/character values. Cleaner for many cases.
• if-else: Best for ranges, complex conditions, or non-integer comparisons.
• switch CANNOT use float or string comparisons.
• Fall-through: Without break, execution continues into next case.

TERNARY OPERATOR
-----------------
condition ? expr_if_true : expr_if_false;
Example: max = (a > b) ? a : b;`,

      notes: `LOOPS IN C
===========

WHILE LOOP
-----------
Checks condition BEFORE executing body. May execute zero times.
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    printf("%d ", i);
    i++;
}
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5

DO-WHILE LOOP
--------------
Executes body FIRST, then checks condition. Always runs at least once.
int i = 1;
do {
    printf("%d ", i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
// Use case: menu-driven programs (show menu first, then check choice)

FOR LOOP
---------
Best when number of iterations is known.
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // body
}
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("%d ", i);
}

MULTIPLE LOOP VARIABLES
------------------------
for (int i = 0, j = 10; i < j; i++, j--) {
    printf("i=%d j=%d\\n", i, j);
}

NESTED LOOPS
-------------
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        printf("%d ", i * j);
    }
    printf("\\n");
}

LOOP CONTROL STATEMENTS
------------------------
• break: Immediately exits the innermost loop or switch.
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      if (i == 5) break;  // stops at 5
  }

• continue: Skips current iteration, jumps to next.
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      if (i % 2 == 0) continue;  // skips even numbers
      printf("%d ", i);  // prints odd: 1 3 5 7 9
  }

• goto: Jumps to a labelled statement. Avoid in structured code — makes code hard to read.
  goto label;
  ...
  label:
      printf("Jumped here");

WHEN TO USE WHICH LOOP
-----------------------
• for: Known iteration count (iterate 10 times, loop over array)
• while: Unknown count, check first (read until EOF)
• do-while: At least one execution guaranteed (menu, input validation)`,

ACCESSING ELEMENTS
-------------------
marks[0] = 90;    // Index starts from 0
marks[4] = 88;    // Last element is at index n-1
// Accessing out of bounds causes undefined behavior!

MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS
--------------------------
int matrix[3][4];          // 3 rows, 4 columns
int mat[2][3] = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}};
// Access: mat[row][col] → mat[1][2] = 6

CHARACTER ARRAYS AND STRINGS
------------------------------
char name[10] = "Alice";    // String stored as char array
// Strings end with null character '\\0'
// "Alice" = {'A','l','i','c','e','\\0'}
printf("%s", name);         // %s for string output

String functions (string.h):
  strlen(str)      — length (not counting '\\0')
  strcpy(dest,src) — copy string
  strcat(dest,src) — concatenate
  strcmp(s1,s2)    — compare (0 = equal)

Group variables of different types under one name.
struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int rollNo;
    float marks;
};
struct Student s1 = {"Alice", 101, 95.5};
printf("%s scored %.1f\\n", s1.name, s1.marks);

Access: s1.name (dot notation), ptr->name (arrow for pointer)

ARRAY OF STRUCTURES
--------------------
struct Student class[30];    // Array of 30 Student records
class[0].rollNo = 1;

UNION
------
Like a structure but all members share the SAME memory location.
Only one member can hold a value at a time. Memory = size of largest member.
union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char c;
};
union Data d; d.f = 3.14;  // Only d.f is valid now

ENUMERATED DATA TYPES (enum)
------------------------------
Assign names to integer constants for readability.
enum Day {MON=1, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN};
enum Day today = WED;       // today = 3
printf("%d", today);        // prints 3`,

      notes: `SEARCHING AND SORTING IN C
===========================

LINEAR SEARCH
--------------
Search each element one by one from start to end.
Time Complexity: O(n) — must check all n elements in worst case.
Best case: O(1) — found at first position.

int linearSearch(int arr[], int n, int key) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == key) return i;  // Return index if found
    }
    return -1;  // Not found
}

Usage: int pos = linearSearch(arr, 5, 78);

Advantages: Simple, works on unsorted data.
Disadvantage: Slow for large arrays.

BUBBLE SORT
------------
Repeatedly compare adjacent elements and swap if out of order.
After each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles" to its correct position.
Time Complexity: O(n²) — worst and average case.
Best case: O(n) — with optimization flag.

void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
        int swapped = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n-1-i; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                // Swap
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                arr[j+1] = temp;
                swapped = 1;
            }
        }
        if (!swapped) break;  // Array already sorted — optimization
    }
}

EXAMPLE TRACE (Bubble Sort on [64, 34, 25, 12, 22])

Pass 1: [34, 25, 12, 22, 64] — 64 placed at end
Pass 2: [25, 12, 22, 34, 64] — 34 placed
Pass 3: [12, 22, 25, 34, 64] — 25 placed

      notes: `FUNCTIONS IN C
===============

WHY FUNCTIONS?
--------------
• Divide a large program into smaller, manageable modules.
• Avoid code repetition — write once, call many times.
• Easier debugging and maintenance.
• Divide and conquer approach: break problem → solve each part → combine.

FUNCTION SYNTAX
----------------
return_type function_name(parameter_list) {
    // body
    return value;
}

Example:
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 3);  // Function call
    printf("%d", result);    // 8
}

TYPES OF FUNCTIONS
-------------------
1. No arguments, no return value: void greet() { printf("Hi"); }
2. Arguments, no return value:    void display(int n) { printf("%d", n); }
3. No arguments, with return:     int getInput() { int x; scanf("%d",&x); return x; }
4. Arguments and return value:    int add(int a, int b) { return a+b; }

FUNCTION PROTOTYPE (Declaration)
----------------------------------
Declared before main() so compiler knows the function signature.
int add(int, int);   // Prototype
int main() { ... }
int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }   // Definition

CALL BY VALUE vs CALL BY REFERENCE
-------------------------------------
• Call by Value: A COPY of the argument is passed. Changes inside function do NOT affect original.
  void increment(int x) { x++; }   // x++ only affects local copy
  
• Call by Reference: Address (pointer) is passed. Changes DIRECTLY affect the original variable.
  void increment(int *x) { (*x)++; }  // Modifies actual variable
  int n = 5;  increment(&n);  // n is now 6

PASSING ARRAYS TO FUNCTIONS
-----------------------------
Arrays are always passed by reference (address of first element).
void printArray(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) printf("%d ", arr[i]);
}
int main() {
    int nums[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    printArray(nums, 5);   // No & needed — array name IS the address
}

RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS
--------------------
A function that calls itself. Must have:
1. Base case — condition that stops recursion.
2. Recursive case — problem reduced towards base case.

int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;  // Base case
    return n * factorial(n - 1);     // Recursive case
}
// factorial(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
}

CALL STACK
-----------
Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack. Excessive recursion causes Stack Overflow. Always ensure base case is reachable.`,

      notes: `POINTERS IN C
==============

WHAT IS A POINTER?
------------------
A pointer is a variable that stores the MEMORY ADDRESS of another variable.
int x = 10;
int *p = &x;   // p holds the address of x
// &x = "address of x" (e.g., 0x7ffd1234)
// *p = "value at address p" = 10 (dereference)

DECLARATION
------------
int *p;        // Pointer to int
float *fp;     // Pointer to float
char *cp;      // Pointer to char
void *vp;      // Void pointer — generic, can point to any type

BASIC OPERATIONS
-----------------
int a = 20;
int *ptr = &a;
printf("%p", ptr);   // Address (e.g., 0x7ffd...)
printf("%d", *ptr);  // Value = 20 (dereferencing)
*ptr = 50;           // Changes a to 50

POINTER ARITHMETIC
-------------------
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int *p = arr;       // Points to arr[0]
p++;                // Now points to arr[1] (advances by sizeof(int) = 4 bytes)
printf("%d", *p);   // 20

p + 2 points to arr[2]. p - q gives number of elements between two pointers.
Valid operations: +, -, ++, -- (adding an integer to a pointer)

NULL POINTER
-------------
int *p = NULL;   // Points to nothing (address 0)
Always check before dereferencing: if (p != NULL) { ... }

POINTERS AND ARRAYS
--------------------
Array name IS a pointer to the first element.
int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
int *p = arr;     // same as &arr[0]
*(p + i) == arr[i]   // Both access same element
p[i] == arr[i]       // Pointer indexing works same as array indexing

ARRAY OF POINTERS
------------------
char *names[] = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};
// Array where each element is a pointer to a string
printf("%s", names[1]);   // "Bob"

POINTERS TO STRUCTURES
------------------------
struct Student s = {"Alice", 101};
struct Student *ptr = &s;
printf("%s", ptr->name);   // Use -> for pointer to struct
// ptr->name same as (*ptr).name

PASSING POINTERS TO FUNCTIONS
-------------------------------
void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}
int x = 5, y = 10;
swap(&x, &y);   // After: x = 10, y = 5

DOUBLE POINTERS
----------------
int x = 10;
int *p = &x;
int **pp = &p;   // Pointer to a pointer
printf("%d", **pp);   // 10`,
