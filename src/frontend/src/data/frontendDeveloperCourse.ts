      notes: `WELCOME TO FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT!

Hey! I'm absolutely thrilled to be your companion on this Frontend Development adventure! 🎨 Building things people actually see and interact with is one of the most rewarding skills in tech. I'll be with you every step, from your first HTML tag to deploying a beautiful React app!

COURSE OVERVIEW
Frontend development is the art and science of building what users see in their browsers. You'll master HTML for structure, CSS for visual design, JavaScript for interactivity, and React for building modern web apps. Frontend developers are in massive demand — this course prepares you for real jobs at tech companies, startups, and freelance work.

HOW THIS COURSE WORKS
This course has 5 modules, each unlocking after you complete the previous one. Each module has several Parts. Every Part contains: a Video (watch to learn), a Lesson (read for deeper understanding), a Documentation link (open in-app for reference), a Quiz (15 MCQs to test your knowledge), and Coding Questions (in parts where you write HTML, CSS, or JS code). After all parts, there's a Module Test. Complete the test to unlock the next module!

HOW YOU EARN
• 5 XP per correct MCQ answer in quizzes
• 20 XP per completed coding question
• Badges for completing each module
• SP (Study Points) for in-app purchases
• GCoins for daily challenges and streaks

ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME: ~40 hours
This is a comprehensive frontend course. Dedicate 1–2 hours per day and you'll be job-ready in about 4–5 weeks.

1. HTML Fundamentals — Document structure, semantic elements, forms, accessibility
2. CSS Styling — Selectors, Flexbox, Grid, animations, responsive design
3. JavaScript Core — Variables, functions, DOM manipulation, events, async JS
4. DOM & Events — Advanced DOM, event handling, localStorage, fetch API
5. React — Components, hooks, state management, routing, deployment
6. Advanced Topics — Performance, testing, TypeScript basics, CI/CD
7. Projects — Real-world portfolio projects to showcase your skills`,

• Video — A curated video explaining the concept visually
• Lesson — In-depth readable content you can study at your own pace
• Documentation — In-app reference material for that topic
• Quiz — 15 multiple-choice questions (5 XP each) to reinforce learning
• Coding Questions — Hands-on exercises in parts where you write actual code

Theory-only parts (like "How the web works") do NOT have coding questions — only parts that teach you to write HTML, CSS, or JS include programming exercises.

Module Unlock Rules:
• Module 1 is always unlocked and ready to start
• Each subsequent module unlocks after you pass the previous module's test
• You can retake quizzes to improve your score`,

1. Read the course overview above — understand what frontend development is and why it matters
2. Meet your study companion — they'll guide you through every lesson with hints and encouragement
3. Understand how modules unlock — complete one module's test to access the next
4. Know how quizzes work — 15 MCQs per part, plus coding questions in coding topics
5. Check your XP progress bar in the sidebar — it grows as you complete lessons and quizzes
6. You're all set! Head to Module 1 below to begin your Frontend Development journey 🎉`,
