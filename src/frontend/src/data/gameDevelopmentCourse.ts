      notes: `WELCOME TO GAME DEVELOPMENT!

Hey! I'm SO excited to be your companion on this Game Development journey! 🎮 Making games is literally one of the most fun things you can do as a developer — and it teaches you everything: physics, graphics, AI, networking, audio, and more. Let's build something amazing together!

COURSE OVERVIEW
Game development is the process of designing and building interactive experiences. This course focuses on Unity (the world's most popular game engine) and C# scripting. You'll learn the core game loop, physics simulation, 2D and 3D game mechanics, UI systems, audio integration, multiplayer basics, and how to publish your games. The skills you learn here also transfer to VR/AR development.

HOW THIS COURSE WORKS
This course has 3 modules, each unlocking after you complete the previous one. Each module has several Parts. Every Part contains: a Video (watch to learn), a Lesson (read for deeper understanding), a Documentation link (open in-app for reference), a Quiz (15 MCQs to test your knowledge), and Coding Questions (in parts where you write C# game scripts). After all parts, there's a Module Test. Complete the test to unlock the next module!

HOW YOU EARN
• 5 XP per correct MCQ answer in quizzes
• 20 XP per completed coding question
• Badges for completing each module
• SP (Study Points) for in-app purchases
• GCoins for daily challenges and streaks

ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME: ~40 hours
This is a fun, hands-on game dev course. Dedicate 1–2 hours per day and you'll have published your first game in about 4–5 weeks.

WHAT TO DO NEXT
Complete the Getting Started checklist below, then scroll down to Module 1 to begin! 🚀`,

1. Game Design Basics — Core game loop, player motivation, level design, balancing mechanics
2. Unity/Godot Fundamentals — Editor navigation, GameObjects, components, scenes, prefabs
3. 2D Games — 2D physics, sprites, tilemaps, animations, camera control
4. 3D Games — 3D transforms, mesh rendering, lights, materials, first/third-person controllers
5. Physics & AI — Rigidbody physics, raycasting, collision detection, NavMesh pathfinding
6. Publishing — Build settings, optimization, platform-specific exports, itch.io/Play Store`,

• Video — A curated video explaining the concept visually
• Lesson — In-depth readable content you can study at your own pace
• Documentation — In-app reference material for that topic
• Quiz — 15 multiple-choice questions (5 XP each) to reinforce learning
• Coding Questions — C# game scripting exercises in coding parts

Pure design/theory parts (like "Game Design Principles") do NOT have coding questions. Only parts where you write actual C# scripts include programming exercises.

Module Unlock Rules:
• Module 1 is always unlocked and ready to start
• Each subsequent module unlocks after you pass the previous module's test
• You can retake quizzes to improve your score`,

1. Read the course overview above — understand what game development is and why it matters
2. Meet your study companion — they'll guide you through every lesson with hints and encouragement
3. Understand how modules unlock — complete one module's test to access the next
4. Know how quizzes work — 15 MCQs per part, plus coding questions in scripting topics
5. Check your XP progress bar in the sidebar — it grows as you complete lessons and quizzes
6. You're all set! Head to Module 1 below to begin your Game Development journey 🎉`,
