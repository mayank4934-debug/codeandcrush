      notes: `WELCOME TO UI/UX DESIGN!

Hey! I'm so excited to be your companion on this UI/UX Design journey! 🎨 Design is where empathy meets creativity meets technology. You'll learn to craft experiences that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable — and companies pay extremely well for that skill!

COURSE OVERVIEW
UI/UX Design is the discipline of creating digital products that are both beautiful and functional. UI (User Interface) focuses on visual design — colors, typography, spacing, components. UX (User Experience) focuses on the user's journey — research, wireframes, usability, information architecture. Together they ensure products are both usable and delightful. This course prepares you to use industry-standard tools like Figma and build a portfolio that gets you hired.

HOW THIS COURSE WORKS
This course has 3 modules, each unlocking after you complete the previous one. Each module has several Parts. Every Part contains: a Video (watch to learn), a Lesson (read for deeper understanding), a Documentation link (open in-app for reference), and a Quiz (15 MCQs to test your knowledge). UI/UX is a design-focused discipline, so parts focus on concepts, tools, and visual thinking rather than programming. After all parts, there's a Module Test. Complete the test to unlock the next module!

HOW YOU EARN
• 5 XP per correct MCQ answer in quizzes
• 20 XP per completed coding question
• Badges for completing each module
• SP (Study Points) for in-app purchases
• GCoins for daily challenges and streaks

ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME: ~30 hours
This is a focused UI/UX course. Dedicate 1–2 hours per day and you'll have a portfolio-ready design skill set in about 3–4 weeks.

1. Design Principles — Visual hierarchy, C.A.R.P., color theory, typography, grid systems
2. User Research — User interviews, surveys, personas, empathy mapping, journey maps
3. Wireframing — Low-fidelity sketches, information architecture, user flows, wireframe tools
4. Prototyping — High-fidelity mockups, interactive prototypes, micro-interactions
5. Figma — Components, auto-layout, variants, design tokens, prototype mode
6. Design Systems — Component libraries, style guides, design tokens, documentation
7. Portfolio — Case studies, presenting your process, handoff to developers`,

• Video — A curated video explaining the concept visually
• Lesson — In-depth readable content you can study at your own pace
• Documentation — In-app reference material for that topic
• Quiz — 15 multiple-choice questions (5 XP each) to reinforce learning

UI/UX Design is primarily a visual and conceptual discipline. This course does not include traditional coding questions — instead, it focuses on design principles, tools, and process thinking that are tested through quizzes.

Module Unlock Rules:
• Module 1 is always unlocked and ready to start
• Each subsequent module unlocks after you pass the previous module's test
• You can retake quizzes to improve your score`,

1. Read the course overview above — understand what UI/UX design is and why it matters
2. Meet your study companion — they'll guide you through every lesson with hints and encouragement
3. Understand how modules unlock — complete one module's test to access the next
4. Know how quizzes work — 15 MCQs per part testing your design knowledge
5. Check your XP progress bar in the sidebar — it grows as you complete lessons and quizzes
6. You're all set! Head to Module 1 below to begin your UI/UX Design journey 🎉`,
